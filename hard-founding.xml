    <h3 id="org710ef71">Founding is lonely</h3>
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org710ef71">
    <p>
    I&rsquo;m a seasoned remote team leader, facilitator, etc.  Remote is my thing, but as a first time founder during a pandemic, staking a new venture feels other-worldly.
    </p>

    <p>
    Founding feels isolated already.  But because of the pandemic I have been isolated from friends and family that don&rsquo;t understand the risk I&rsquo;m taking, and because we&rsquo;re fully remote I&rsquo;m always isolated from the only people who do understand.  My co-founders!
    </p>

    <p>
    I should use the word isolated more carefully here but, what I mean by that is no in-person contact.
    </p>

    <p>
    My co-founders and myself communicate constantly!  There&rsquo;s no argument.  Without them I would probably loose touch with reality.  With a pandemic this is for many reasons but with founding being as lonely as it is, I can&rsquo;t imagine what it would feel like without my partners.

    <div id="outline-container-orgff37751" class="outline-3">
    <h3 id="orgff37751">Moral &amp; Social support</h3>
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgff37751">
    <p>
    I mentioned it before, how friends and family don&rsquo;t understand.  How could they really?
    </p>

    <p>
    Trying to start a company is incredibly risky and it is not something everyone close to me understands intuitively.  When developing a product in a world that they are only users of, it&rsquo;s hard to explain the complex nuances of what I&rsquo;m working on in a way that relates to or diminishes the risk I&rsquo;m taking in their eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is why I feel having co-founders is crucial.  Moral and social support from those who understand or have skin in the game too should not be overlooked!  I often find myself reading super-person accounts of solo-founders &ldquo;crushing it&rdquo; and wondering how they do it.  I still wonder.

    <h3 id="org8be25ed">Network, Network, Network!</h3>
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8be25ed">
    <p>
    How big is your network?
    </p>

    <p>
    My network is greater than 3x my own due to the addition of my co-founders.  Having a strong network as a founder is crucial!  In aggregate we have a rolodex that is hard to beat.
    </p>

    <p>
    So far we&rsquo;ve tapped our networks directly for:

    <li>Recruitment</li>
    <li>Advice</li>
    <li>Lead Generation</li>
    </ul>

    The list continues to grow.  Another thing I</p>
