<section id="outline-container-org29f66df" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org29f66df">Co-founders are key to my success</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org29f66df">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9787d91" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9787d91">Founding is lonely</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9787d91">
<p>
I&rsquo;m a seasoned remote team leader, facilitator, etc.  Remote is my thing, but as a first time founder during a pandemic, staking a new venture feels other-worldly.
</p>

<p>
Founding feels isolated already.  But because of the pandemic I have been isolated from friends and family that don&rsquo;t understand the risk I&rsquo;m taking, and because we&rsquo;re fully remote I&rsquo;m always isolated from the only people who do understand.  My co-founders!
</p>

<p>
I should use the word isolated more carefully here but, what I mean by that is no in-person contact.
</p>

<p>
My co-founders and myself communicate constantly!  There&rsquo;s no argument.  Without them I would probably loose touch with reality.  With a pandemic this is for many reasons but with founding being as lonely as it is, I can&rsquo;t imagine what it would feel like without my partners.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgade037c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgade037c">Moral &amp; Social support</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgade037c">
<p>
I mentioned it before, how friends and family don&rsquo;t understand.  How could they really?
</p>

<p>
Trying to start a company is incredibly risky and it is not something everyone close to me understands intuitively.  When developing a product in a world that they are only users of, it&rsquo;s hard to explain the complex nuances of what I&rsquo;m working on in a way that relates to or diminishes the risk I&rsquo;m taking in their eyes.
</p>

<p>
This is why I feel having co-founders is crucial.  Moral and social support from those who understand or have skin in the game too should not be overlooked!  I often find myself reading super-person accounts of solo-founders &ldquo;crushing it&rdquo; and wondering how they do it.  I still wonder.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2979e27" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2979e27">Network, Network, Network!</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2979e27">
<p>
How big is your network?
</p>

<p>
My network is greater than 3x my own due to the addition of my co-founders.  Having a strong network as a founder is crucial!  In aggregate we have a rolodex that is hard to beat.
</p>

<p>
So far we&rsquo;ve tapped our networks directly for:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Recruitment</li>
<li>Advice</li>
<li>Lead Generation</li>
</ul>

<p>
The list continues to grow.  Another thing I find hard to imagine is what it would be like without each of us having a solid network.  Certainly just my own would not suffice, and not to brag but my network is <b>stellar</b> IMHO.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2e8c007" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2e8c007">Share bandwidth</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2e8c007">
<p>
Eventually you&rsquo;ll have to enlist the help of others.  It is impossible to do everything alone.  Having co-founders makes it that much easier to divide and conquer the vastness of entrepeneurship.
</p>

<p>
Again this is another area where I find it hard to imagine success without the bandwidth of my co-founders brought to arms.  While someone is focuses on lead generation another can be recruiting, etc.
</p>

<p>
I look forward to looking back on this blog and reminiscing with my co-founders about all the trials we worked through together.  I can&rsquo;t imagine I&rsquo;ll get there alone.
